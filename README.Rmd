Tools to Transform and Query Data with 'Apache' 'Drill' (JDBC)

## NOTE

This is the Java/JDBC-interface to Apache Drill. For non-Java/JDBC, see the `sergeant` package ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/hrbrmstr/sergeant/); [GitHub](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/sergeant/)).

## Description

Drill + `sergeant` is (IMO) a streamlined alternative to Spark + `sparklyr` if you don't need the ML components of Spark (i.e. just need to query "big data" sources, need to interface with parquet, need to combine disparate data source types ‚Äî json, csv, parquet, rdbms - for aggregation, etc). Drill also has support for spatial queries.

Using Drill SQL queries that reference parquet files on a local linux or macOS workstation can often be more performant than doing the same data ingestion & wrangling work with R (especially for large or disperate data sets). Drill can often help further streaming workflows that infolve wrangling many tiny JSON files on a daily basis.

Drill can be obtained from <https://drill.apache.org/download/> (use "Direct File Download"). Drill can also be installed via [Docker](https://drill.apache.org/docs/running-drill-on-docker/). For local installs on Unix-like systems, a common/suggestion location for the Drill directory is  `/usr/local/drill` as the install directory. 

Drill embedded (started using the `$DRILL_BASE_DIR/bin/drill-embedded` script) is a super-easy way to get started playing with Drill on a single workstation and most of many workflows can "get by" using Drill this way.

The following functions are implemented:

**`DBI`** (RJDBC)

- `drill_jdbc`:	Connect to Drill using JDBC, enabling use of said idioms. See `RJDBC` for more info.

NOTE: The DRILL JDBC driver fully-qualified path must be placed in the `DRILL_JDBC_JAR` environment variable. This is best done via `~/.Renviron` for interactive work. i.e. `DRILL_JDBC_JAR=/usr/local/drill/jars/drill-jdbc-all-1.14.0.jar`

**`dplyr`**: (RJDBC)

- `src_drill_jdbc`: Connect to Drill (using dplyr & RJDBC) + supporting functions

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/hrbrmstr/sergeant-caffeinated")
# OF
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/sergeant-caffeinated")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
options(width=120)
```

## Usage

```{r dplyr-01, message=FALSE}
library(sergeant.caffeinated)
library(tidyverse)

# use localhost if running standalone on same system otherwise the host or IP of your Drill server
ds <- src_drill_jdbc("localhost")  #ds
db <- tbl(ds, "cp.`employee.json`") 

# without `collect()`:
count(db, gender, marital_status)

count(db, gender, marital_status) %>% collect()

group_by(db, position_title) %>% 
  count(gender) -> tmp2

group_by(db, position_title) %>% 
  count(gender) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(full_desc=ifelse(gender=="F", "Female", "Male")) %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  select(Title=position_title, Gender=full_desc, Count=n)

arrange(db, desc(employee_id)) %>% print(n=20)

mutate(db, position_title=tolower(position_title)) %>%
  mutate(salary=as.numeric(salary)) %>% 
  mutate(gender=ifelse(gender=="F", "Female", "Male")) %>%
  mutate(marital_status=ifelse(marital_status=="S", "Single", "Married")) %>% 
  group_by(supervisor_id) %>% 
  summarise(underlings_count=n()) %>% 
  collect()
```

```
